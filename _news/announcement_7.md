ðŸŽ‰ Thrilled to announce our recent publication in Science Advances (Science Magazine) on the impact of ARID1A mutations in cancer development.

A huge shoutout to my colleagues Alessandro D'Ambrosio and Elisa Ferracci for their incredible dedication and hard work. A sincere thank you to all our collaborators and to Prof. Fulvio Chiacchiera for his inspirational guidance and supervision throughout this project. I also want to express our gratitude to AIRC - The Italian Foundation for Cancer Research ETS and Worldwide Cancer Research for their funding support.

Our research reveals that ARID1A mutations in healthy tissue can cause genomic instability and, under microenvironmental pressures, give rise to aggressive liver tumours.
